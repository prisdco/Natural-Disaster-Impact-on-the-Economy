# Natural-Disaster-Impact-on-the-Economy

Natural disasters’ effects can threaten the firmness of the economy but are often underestimated. Due to the underestimation of this threat, current economic models in Nigeria don’t often incorporate its impact on key economic indicators, thereby hindering the development of effective strategies to mitigate its effect on the economy. Using the time series model (SARIMA and PROPHET), this research aims to understand natural disasters’ impact (floods) on Nigeria’s economy (crude oil) for early detection of economic recession.
